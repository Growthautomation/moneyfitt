This is the project overview for the financial advisor mathcing project.

This is a Next.js project
Right now we are prototyping so there is not backend, always use local temporary storage that resets on restart.
We are only creating the front end look and functionalityfor now

Main features are
- User Onboarding via a series of questions
- Homepage that shows advisor profile cards, 3 of them
- Homepage that has relevant articles
- Homepage that shows the summary of convesations with the 3 advisors
- Chat page that shows the conversation with 1 advisor
- Chat page that shows the indepth advisor profile
- User can swap an advisor via a swap button on the profile, they can do this 3 times per day, they system will find another advisor, the advisor card will show loading then the new advisor will show.

Flow is Onboarding -> Homepage -> ChatPage -> Homepage

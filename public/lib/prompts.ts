questions the user could ask to learn more about their financial situation or options 
in Singapore or to question the insurance or financial advice given. These should be phrased as questions the user would ask. Don't number them. 
Separate each question with a double pipe (||) ALWAYS DO THIS. The questions should always be from 
the user's perspective, using simple language without jargon. Make sure the first two questions are based on the current conversation so are a reply
to the advisor message. they dont need to be questions the can be resonponses to the advisors but only use ones that will add value to the user.`;

- Whether the advice given seems appropriate for the user's needs
- Any potential risks or benefits of the services offered
- Areas where more information might be needed
- Any discrepancies or unclear points in the advisor's statements

In your analysis, be careful not to give direct financial advice. Instead, focus on analyzing the conversation and the advisor's recommendations in relation to what we know about the user. Use phrases like "It appears that..." or "Based on the conversation, it seems..." to maintain a neutral stance.

Format your output as follows:
<summary>
[Insert your quick summary here]
</summary>

<main_points>
- [Main point 1]
- [Main point 2]
- [Main point 3]

<services_offered>

<analysis>
[Insert your analysis here]
</analysis>

Remember to base all your responses solely on the information provided in the conversation and user details. Do not make assumptions or include information not present in the given context. Lets do this while relating to the User instead of doing it in the third person. If the advisor has a name use that name to refer to the advisor.

The user should understand not only if its the right product but why that product. We are looking out for the user and making sure that there is transparency in the fees the advisor gets.

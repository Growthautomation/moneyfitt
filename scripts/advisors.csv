Since then I've gone through several life altering experiences (ask me about it, I'm open to sharing) that shaped what I do today, which is help people prepare themselves so that they have a plan in mind set up when they find themselves in those same financially taxing and mind boggling situations. 

I'm curious about people and want to learn more about them
I'm a course junkie and regularly upgrade myself
I'm a board game junkie and I love strategy games (aside from chess which is like a daily thing)
I enjoy thought provoking conversations that are too complicated for me to understand because it challenges me to learn more
I'm a very chatty introvert (once I open up)
I challenge myself through physical activities and I'm passionate about living a healthy life to its fullest.

At my very core I enjoy connecting with people from various backgrounds from different countries, learning about how they grow up and what drives them, their passions and their dreams, and deep down inside I truly enjoy helping people. I want to climb with them on this mountain of life laden with financial dangers with them, empower them as a personal guide and watch their backs.

Since switching over to Max, I have saved thousands on premiums and for better coverage. This only happened because Max took the time to understand my household’s requirements, analyse options, and formulate plans that struck the perfect balance between cost and value.
